## Program structure

## Capstone project rubric

The README indicates which rubric points are addressed. The README also indicates where in the code (i.e. files and line numbers) that the rubric points are addressed.

* The project demonstrates an understanding of C++ functions and control structures. -> loops, functions

* The project reads data from a file and process the data, or the program writes data to a file. -> possible cards

* The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques. -> classes, member functions

* Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members. -> public, private

* The project uses move semantics to move data, instead of copying it, where possible. -> ???

* The project uses multithreading. -> 2 players

* A mutex or lock is used in the project. -> ???

* A condition variable is used in the project. -> ???
